# Drafter & Drafter Client

This repo contains both the Drafter Server and a version locked
Clojure client to that server.

There are two README's depending on what you want, choose your path

- [Drafter](/drafter/README.md)
- [Drafter Client](/drafter-client/README.md)

CI in this project should build and test Drafter first, then use that
Drafter to build and test the client.
