# Drafter & Drafter Client

This repo contains both the Drafter Server and a version locked
Clojure client to that server.

There are two README's depending on what you want, choose your path

- [Drafter](/drafter/README.md)
- [Drafter Client](/drafter-client/README.md)

CI in this project should build and test Drafter first, then use that
Drafter to build and test the client.

### Usage expectation

Although now released under an open licence we expect that Drafter is, at the current time at least, probably not that useful for others who aren't using other components of the hosted PublishMyData service. This may change over time.
