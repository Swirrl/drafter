# Using Drafter as a Service (API Docs)

Drafter 2 exposes its API documentation along with a tool for driving the API through its web interface (via SwaggerUI). By default, this is available at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)


If you don't have a running drafter and wish to consult the documentation you will need to inspect the Yaml file from which the above is generated: [/drafter/doc/drafter.yml](drafter.yml).
