  "This namespace implements a priority job queue of pending writes, and is
  responsible for ensuring writes are linearised without synchronous operations
  blocking for too long.

  Long running synchronous operations can be scheduled as :publish-writes
  meaning any other concurrent write attempts will fail fast, rather block.

  The public functions in this namespace are concerned with submitting jobs and
  waiting for their results.

  Jobs can be added to the write queue using the queue-job! function."
