* Getting started

Not developing drafter itself then just grab a recent build from
[[https://build.publishmydata.com/view/Grafter%2520master/job/drafter/][Jenkins]].

* Developing Drafter

- clone this project
- [[http://leiningen.org/#install][Install leiningen]]
- cd into the project directory =cd drafter=
- =lein repl= This will start an http server on port 3001

To run a dev build of the drafter server with configuration defaults
(port 3001 and a repo stored in =./drafter-db=) simply run:

=$ lein repl=

To run the tests from the console:

=$ lein test=

To run a test from a repl, make sure the test namespace is loaded
(evaling it will usually do this) then run (for example):

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(clojure.test/run-tests 'drafter.routes.sparql-test)
#+END_SRC

To build:

=$ lein uberjar=

To run a built drafter server (without leiningen or a repl) on port 3001:

=$ java -jar target/drafter-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar=
