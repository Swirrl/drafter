** Testing 


1. To run the unit tests you must currently have a database called
   =drafter-test-db= created and ready.  You can create this with the
   command: =stardog-admin db create -n drafter-test-db=
2. To run these tests from the console run the command:

=$ lein test=

** Local Development

1. You should also create a database for local
   development. =stardog-admin db create drafter-dev-db=

2. =lein repl=
3. =(dev)= to load dev namespace
4. =(start-system!)= To start the drafter service on the configured port.
